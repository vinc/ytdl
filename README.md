# ytdl

YouTube Video Downloader


## Genesis (2020-10-23)

Yesterday [YouTube-dl][1] received a [DMCA takedown from RIAA][2] and its
git repositories were disabled on GitHub. Well, that sucks.

It's such a great tool when you have a limited internet access to download
videos in the format of your choice instead of streaming them. But it did
a bit too much, including being able to download content protected by DRM
and the RIAA didn't like that.

In reaction to this I wrote a small tool in ruby called ytdl that do less
and focus on videos from YouTube without DRM.
